                <p>For the most projects, you’ll want a footer that stays at the bottom of the screen, regardless of the size of the content — if the page’s content goes past the view-port, the footer should adapt.
                    Before CSS3, it was very difficult to achieve this effect without knowing the exact height of your footer. And, although we call it a sticky footer, you can’t simply solve this with position: sticky , because that can block content.
                    Today, the most compatible solution is to use Flexbox. The key is to use the less well-known flex-grow property on the div containing the main content of the page; in the example below, I’m using the main tag.
                    flex-grow controls how much a flex item fills its container, relative to other flex elements. With a value of 0, it won’t grow at all, and so we need to set it to 1 or more. In the example below, I’ve used the shorthand property flex: auto , which sets flex-grow to 1 by default.
                    To prevent any unwanted behaviour, we can also add flex-shrink: 0 to the footer tag. flex-shrink is effectively the opposite of the flex-grow property, controlling the amount a flex element shrinks to fit into its container, and setting it to 0 will prevent the footer from shrinking at all — ensuring that it retains its dimensions.
